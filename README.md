# Microservices Persistent Communication

## This is just an exercise, not considered totally reliable

### Persisting calls to microservices

Sometimes you really want to be sure the calls made to your services are really successful. If a service is down, important requests could be lost forever.
Instead of calling your services directly, you can proxy the calls through this tool, which will forward the calls to the actual services.
If a call is rejected because service is down, it will be retried until successful (configurable).

#### Setup

* Install Git
* Install Docker
* Install Docker compose
* Clone this repository
* cp env.dist.yml env.yml
* docker-compose up -d (if RABBITMQ_HIPE_COMPILE option set to 1 - see Configuration -, the service can take up to a few minutes to start)

#### Configuration (env.yml)
```
QUEUE_SCHEME: "amqp" Queue scheme
QUEUE_HOST: "queue" Queue service name as defined in docker-compose.yml
QUEUE_PORT: "5672" Port for queue instance
QUEUE_NAME: "services" Name of queue
QUEUE_NUMBER_OF_CONSUMERS: 3 Number of queue consumers
REQUEUE_FAILED_AFTER_MILLISECONDS: 5000 Time to requeue failed calls after
FILE_LOG_ENABLED: 1 If 1, logs will pe published to file (disable to reduce disk IO)
FAST_PUBLISH: 0 Performance tweaking. If 1, data validation will not be performed when making a request. Request is ignored only if body is empty, any other input is accepted. If no url, the consumers will ignore the calls and will remove them from queue.
AUTHORIZATION_HEADER: X-Authorization Authorization header key for requests authorization
AUTHORIZATION_KEY: yourauthorizationkey Authorization key for requests. If empty, unauthorized requests are allowed.
TLS: 0 If 1, server will start on TLS. Certificates are required in the ./ssl directory.
REDIRECT_TO_TLS: 1 Available only when TLS is 1. If 1, http requests will be redirected to https; if 0, http requests are not allowed.
RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: "usernameforrabbitmq" Username for rabbitmq instance
RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: "passwordforrabbitmq" Password for rabbitmq instance
RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST: "/" Vhost for rabbitmq instance
RABBITMQ_HIPE_COMPILE: 1 See "hipe_compile" https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html
```

#### Request

* Url: 0.0.0.0:8008
* Body: Json string with the following properties:
    * url (string) The service url (accepted protocols: http, https )
    * method (string, optional, default GET) GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE
    * headers (object, optional) Key - value object with headers to send
    * body (string, optional) String to send as body (accepted content type: json, xml)
    * requeue (bool, optional, default true) Whether to requeue failed calls or not
* Examples
    ```
    {
        "url" : "https://api.myservicedomain.tld/notification",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": {"X-Auth": "MyAuthKey", "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"},
        "body": "{\"receiver\": \"john.doe@domain.tld\", \"text\": \"Welcome to the machine!\"}"
    }
    ```

    ```
    {
        "url" : "https://api.myservicedomain.tld/ping",
        "requeue": false
    }
    ```
* Test
    ```
    curl -X POST -H "X-Authorization: NTRjMTVhOWVhMzBiNjgwZWUyNjRkMzRjZDk2ODhmN2RjOWQ1ZTkzM2VhMmNiYjRiODFjOGI1ZDNkMTk1NDUzMzoxNDgyOTM4MDk4" -k -d '{
                "url" : "https://api.myservicedomain.tld/notification",
                "method": "POST",
                "headers": {"X-Auth": "MyAuthKey", "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"},
                "body": "{\"receiver\": \"john.doe@domain.tld\", \"text\": \"Welcome to the machine!\"}"
            }' http://0.0.0.0:8008/
    ```

#### Response

* Status codes
    * 200 Only for requests with FAST_PUBLISH set to 1
    * 202 Request was accepted
    * 400 Invalid request body properties
    * 401 For authorized requests with invalid authorization hash
    * 404
    * 422 Invalid body syntax
* Body: Json string with the following properties:
    * error (bool) Whether the publish was successful or not
    * message (string) Success or error message

#### Workflow

* You make a request to this service.
* The request is validated (if FAST_PUBLISH is set to 0).
* Your request is sent to a queue.
* One or many consumers (QUEUE_NUMBER_OF_CONSUMERS) process the queue and perform the calls.
* If a call fails (and requeue property was not sent false), it will be requeued after a specified time (REQUEUE_FAILED_AFTER_MILLISECONDS).

#### Call validation rules

Your services must return an http status code in 2xx class (Success) for a call to be considered successful.

#### Security

One way to secure requests to this service is to have it behind a firewall, and accept requests only from known hosts.

Also, a basic authorization can be used by sending the authorization header (see AUTHORIZATION_HEADER in Configuration) with the authorization hash.
Generate the authorization hash: base64(sha256(timestamp:authorizationkey):timestamp)

Port 15672 open for Rabbitmq management should also be behind a firewall.

* unixtimestamp: Unix timestamp
* authorizationkey: See AUTHORIZATION_KEY in Configuration

If you want to start the server on TLS, set TLS option to 1 and place the certificates inside the ./ssl directory, named as:

* server.crt
* server.key

#### Scaling

You can set up this tool on multiple machines and have a load balancer in front.
Also, you can increase number of consumers (see QUEUE_NUMBER_OF_CONSUMERS in Configuration).

#### Performance testing

* https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html
* Save a body (see examples) in a file (post.json)
* ab -n 1000 -c 100 -v 1 -p post.json -v 0 http://0.0.0.0:8008/

#### Development

* Rebuild and run service: docker-compose up -d --build
* Rebuild and run app: docker-compose exec app go get && docker-compose restart app
* Logs: docker-compose logs -f app

#### Nice to have

* Nicer error messages
* Logs for all calls
* Handle messages that failed to be published to the services queue
* Option to delete all messages from queue
* Redeclare queue if it was manually deleted
